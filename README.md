Welcome to Vika's Repository!
This repository is filled with my passion projects that I have been doing to learn Python better on my own. This has been fulfilling odyssey filled with joy, frustration, anger, hopelessness and immense satisfaction.
I hope these projects give you an brief overview of my technical capabilities, problem-solving approach, and ability to develop functional, user-centric applications.
This is just the start and I look forward to hone thses skills and build projects that can solve real-world problems.
Each project reflects my commitment to writing efficient code, utilizing the best practices in software development, and continuously learning new technologies.
Thank you for taking the time to view my projects!
